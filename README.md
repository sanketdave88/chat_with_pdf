# **Custom Knowledge ChatGPT with LangChain - Chat with PDFs**

This project demonstrates how to create a custom chatbot using ChatGPT with the LangChain library, specifically designed to interact with PDF documents. The notebook covers the installation of necessary libraries, loading and processing PDF files, embedding text, creating a retrieval function, and optionally, setting up a chatbot with memory.

## Table of Contents

1. [Installation and Setup](#installation-and-setup)
2. [Loading PDFs and Chunking with LangChain](#loading-pdfs-and-chunking-with-langchain)
3. [Embedding Text and Storing Embeddings](#embedding-text-and-storing-embeddings)
4. [Creating a Retrieval Function](#creating-a-retrieval-function)
5. [Optional: Creating a Chatbot with Memory](#optional-creating-a-chatbot-with-memory)

## Installation and Setup

Before running the notebook, ensure that you have installed the necessary Python packages. The following commands install all required dependencies:

```bash
# Install primary libraries
pip install -q fastapi kaleido python-multipart uvicorn cohere six beautifulsoup4

# Install LangChain and related dependencies
pip install -q langchain==0.0.316 pypdf pandas matplotlib tiktoken textract transformers openai==0.28.1 faiss-cpu

# Install additional utilities
pip install -q anyio distro httpx pydantic sniffio tqdm typing-extensions
```

Make sure you have Python installed by running:

```bash
python --version
```

Check the OpenAI installation:

```bash
pip show openai
```

### API Keys

You will need API keys from OpenAI and Hugging Face to run this project. These keys should be set as environment variables in your Python environment:

```python
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "YOUR-API-KEY"
os.environ["HF_TOKEN"] = "YOUR-API-KEY"
```

## Loading PDFs and Chunking with LangChain

The first step is to load PDF files and chunk them into manageable pieces for processing. This is done using LangChain's `PyPDFLoader` and `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` tools.

## Embedding Text and Storing Embeddings

After chunking the text, the next step is to embed the text using OpenAI's embeddings. The embeddings are stored in a FAISS vector store, which allows for efficient similarity search and retrieval.

## Creating a Retrieval Function

This section outlines how to create a retrieval function using LangChain's `load_qa_chain` and `ConversationalRetrievalChain`. These functions help in querying the embedded texts to find relevant information based on user inputs.

## Optional: Creating a Chatbot with Memory

An optional section in the notebook explains how to create a chatbot that retains conversation history, enhancing the interaction by providing context-aware responses.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/custom-knowledge-chatgpt-langchain.git
    cd custom-knowledge-chatgpt-langchain
    ```

2. Install the required packages (see [Installation and Setup](#installation-and-setup)).

3. Set your API keys.

4. Run the Jupyter notebook to process your PDFs and interact with the custom chatbot.
